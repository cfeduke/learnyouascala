# Introduction

## About

This is a book about Scala. An approachable book, with clear writing and clear examples, with minimal ivory tower academic overtones about functional programming. If you're here for the functional programming, don't worry! I began writing this book solely with the interest in producing a manuscript similar to Learn You a Haskell [@lipovaca11].
